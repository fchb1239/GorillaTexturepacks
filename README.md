# GorillaTexturepacks
A mod that lets you load your own texturepakcs into Gorilla Tag!

# Installing packs
Open up stream and find Gorill Tag, click the gear icon to the far right.
After clicking it you click (insert word i forgot here) -> "Browse Local Game Files".
Go into the "BepInEx" -> "Plugins" -> "GorillaTexturepacks" -> "Packs" and drag your pack in there.

There is already a demo pack, delete it if you want.

# Creating a pack
Start of by downloading the Gorilla Texturepacks Editor (here).

After launching the program you should see this:

Click on the button of the texture you would like to start of by changing.
You have to change all of them so it doesn't matter what order you do this in.

After that you have to name your pack and add a description. Put your name into the creator name text field,
pack name in the pack name text file and so on.
Then click "Export".

Now go to where you launched the program from and go into the folder labelled "Exports". In there you should be able to find
the file you just exported.
