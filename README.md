# Creating a pack
Start of by downloading the Gorilla Texturepacks Editor (here).

Click on the button of the texture you would like to start of by changing.
You have to change all of them so it doesn't matter what order you do this in.

After that you have to name your pack and add a description. Put your name into the creator name text field,
pack name in the pack name text file and so on.
Then click "Export".
